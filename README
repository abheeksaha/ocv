There are three programs here

a. gdyn is stage 1 and what should run on the Mobile. It reads data from a file, does initial processing
and then transmits both the video and the output code on RTP using payload types 96 and 102 respectively.
By default it transmits on port 50018, use the -p option to change this

b. gsproc is the intermediate stage; it takes in two streams (video and data) and outputs two streams 
(video and data). It listens to port 50018

c. grcvr is the final stage, which displays the video. It listens to port 50019

As of today, these work on TCP and not UDP. Each stage acts as the server for the stage before it and 
as the client for the stage afterwards. Hence, to start up, you have to run grcvr first,
then gsproc and finally gdyn. grcvr uses port 50019 by default (it can be changed using -r <recv port>.
gsproc uses 50018 by default; this can be changed using gsproc -r <recv port> -s <send port> -i <send ip>.
Finally, gdyn uses -p <send port> -i <send ip> to set the destination address.
