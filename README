There are now only 2 programs. One (gdyn) will run on the container in the edge and the second (grcrv)
will run on the backend.

a. gdyn is stage 1 and what should run on the edge container. Note that this is a change from the earlier mode. 
gdyn has two modes of operation. If you call it with -f <filename> it reads data from a file, does initial 
processing and then transmits both the video and the output code on RTP using payload types 96 and 102 respectively.
By default it transmits on port 50018, use the -p option to change this. This mode is for testing. For field 
running, you have to call it with gdyn -n <recv port>. It then waits for streamed rtp/udp packets from an
external player that it will then process and forward.

b. gsproc is no longer needed as of now. I may add it as an intermediate state if needed.

c. udpclient.sh is a small script which will run on the mobile. It will simply take an input file and play
it out to the destination address and port. Run udpclient.sh -h to see how to give it parameters

c. grcvr is the final stage, which displays the video. It listens to port 50019

gdyn and grcvr communicate using TCP, which saves us from packet dropping; there may be delays however. For
both programs, use the -h option to see how to set the destination and transmit ports and (in the case of
gdyn) the transmit IP address.

========================
Added a new mode to grcvr. If you call grcvr with the options => grcvr -r <inport> -p <oport> --mode=inter, it
will act as a relay stage allowing you to add arbitrary intermediate stages...technically you can do:
Machine1: ./grcvr -r 50020
Machine2: ./grcvr -r 50019 -p 50020 -i<ip address of Machine1> --mode=inter
Machine3: ./grcvr -r 50018 -p 50019  -i<ip address of Machine2> --mode=inter
Machine4: ./gdyn -n 50017 -p 50018  -i<ip address of Machine3>// Opens gdyn in network mode, listening to port 50017
Machine5: ./udpclient.sh 50017 <ipaddress of machine4>

And you should have a flow of video frames from udpclient to gdyn to two intermediate grcvr stages to final grcvr
stage where it will be displayed. I have only tested one intermediate stage, my machine cannot handle all these
other stages.
