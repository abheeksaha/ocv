There are three programs here

a. gdyn is stage 1 and what should run on the Mobile. It reads data from a file, does initial processing
and then transmits both the video and the output code on RTP using payload types 96 and 102 respectively.
By default it transmits on port 50018, use the -p option to change this

b. gsproc is the intermediate stage; it takes in two streams (video and data) and outputs two streams 
(video and data). It listens to port 50018

c. grcvr is the final stage, which displays the video. It listens to port 50019

To connect gdyn directly to grcvr, use gdyn -p 50019. Otherwise, it will go through gsproc. There is a buffering/corruption
error that I am still working on.
